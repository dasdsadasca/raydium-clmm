Hi [Team/Rainray],

Thank you for the continued discussion and for clarifying your perspective on the design. I appreciate your engagement in pinpointing the exact nature of the concern.

Let's address the points from your latest message, especially concerning the calculation of `fee_growth_inside` when the current price is outside a position's range, and how this relates to the Uniswap v3 implementation you've referenced.

**1. Regarding the calculation of `fee_growth_inside` when the current price (`tick_current`) is outside the position range `[T_L, T_U]`:**

I agree that if a position was previously in range and accrued fees, those fees must remain claimable. The `fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` snapshot in `PersonalPositionState` is precisely for this.

My core concern is with how the *current total accumulated growth inside the range* is determined by `get_fee_growth_inside` when `tick_current` is *currently outside* this range. In your codebase, this calculation simplifies to:
*   If `tick_current < T_L.tick`: `FIG_calculated = T_L.fee_growth_outside_X .wrapping_sub( T_U.fee_growth_outside_X )` (let's use `O_L` and `O_U` for these outside values).
*   If `tick_current >= T_U.tick`: `FIG_calculated = O_U.wrapping_sub( O_L )`.

The values `O_L` and `O_U` are independent historical snapshots from when `T_L` and `T_U` were last relevant (initialized or crossed), based on *then-current* global fee growths. It is entirely possible that `O_U > O_L` (or vice-versa). Your stated invariant `fee_growth_global_x64 >= tick_X.fee_growth_outside_x_x64` (for any single tick X) holds for each snapshot against *its respective* global growth at the time of snapshotting, but it does not enforce a specific relationship *between O_L and O_U themselves today*.

If, for example, `O_U > O_L` and the current price is below `T_L`, your code's `O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U)` produces an **erroneously massive positive number** (due to `u128` wrapping, e.g., `100 - 500 + 2^128`). This massive value is an arithmetic artifact; it doesn't represent any real fees accumulated *within* the range when the price is outside. Logically, if the price is outside the range, the *current rate* of fee accumulation *inside* that range is zero.

**Crucial Difference from Uniswap v3 (`Tick.sol#L60`):**
The Solidity code for `getFeeGrowthInside`, when `tickCurrent < tickLower`, effectively calculates `lower.feeGrowthOutside - upper.feeGrowthOutside`. If `upper.feeGrowthOutside > lower.feeGrowthOutside`, standard Solidity checked arithmetic (default since 0.8.0, or via SafeMath) **would cause the transaction to REVERT due to underflow.** It would *not* produce a massive wrapped positive value for `feeGrowthInside`. This difference in behavior—revert vs. producing a massive artifactual value—is critical. Uniswap v3 prevents this artifactual value from being generated.

**2. Regarding the "Delta Accuracy" and the effect of the `wrapping_sub` artifact:**

Your example (`last_FG = MAX-1000`, `current_FG = 500` => `delta = 1500`) correctly shows `wrapping_sub` for a delta where a counter *legitimately and continuously wraps*.

The exploit scenario I've detailed is different because the `current_FIG_for_range` (which updates `ProtocolPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64`) **is not a result of legitimate, continuous accumulation.** It becomes the artifactual `W_FIG` (the massive number close to `U128::MAX`) due to the flawed out-of-range calculation in `get_fee_growth_inside`.

The exploit proceeds as follows:
a.  The `get_fee_growth_inside` function incorrectly calculates the artifactual `W_FIG`.
b.  This `W_FIG` updates `ProtocolPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64`.
c.  A `PersonalPositionState` has its own `fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` (let's call it `P_FIG_normal`), which was a normal, non-wrapped value from its *previous* update.
d.  When this personal position then claims fees, `calculate_latest_token_fees` computes the user's delta as:
    `user_delta = W_FIG (from ProtocolPositionState) .wrapping_sub( P_FIG_normal (from PersonalPositionState) )`
    (Note: `calculate_latest_token_fees` in `increase_liquidity.rs` uses `latest_protocol_fig.wrapping_sub(personal_last_fig)` where `latest_protocol_fig` is `protocol_position.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` and `personal_last_fig` is `personal_position.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64`).
e.  This calculation (`MassiveArtifactualValue - SmallNormalValue`) yields a **huge, incorrect positive delta for the user.** This is the exploitable step. It's not a legitimate delta within a consistently wrapped system; it's a delta created by injecting an artifactual massive value as the current reference.

**3. Devnet POC & Clarifying the Exploit Path:**

I understand your request for a devnet POC. The core of such a POC would be to first engineer a state where `tick_lower.fee_growth_outside_X` (O_L) and `tick_upper.fee_growth_outside_X` (O_U) have the necessary relationship (e.g., O_U > O_L) by carefully timing tick crossings relative to global fee growth.
*   **Setup Tick States:**
    1.  Initialize a pool.
    2.  Cross `T_L` when global fees are relatively low (e.g., `G1`), setting `O_L` based on `G1`.
    3.  Allow global fees to increase significantly to `G2` (`G2 >> G1`).
    4.  Cross `T_U` when global fees are `G2`, setting `O_U` based on `G2`. Now, `O_U` is substantially larger than `O_L`.
*   **Exploit:**
    1.  Attacker opens a minimal liquidity position (P1) in `[T_L, T_U]`. Record its initial `PersonalPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` (`P1_FIG_initial`).
    2.  Move `tick_current < T_L`.
    3.  Trigger an update to the `ProtocolPositionState` for `[T_L, T_U]`. `get_fee_growth_inside` calculates `FIG_calculated = O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U)`, resulting in `W_FIG` (huge wrapped number). `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` becomes `W_FIG`. (This state should be verified on devnet).
    4.  Attacker updates their position P1. `calculate_latest_token_fees` computes `delta = W_FIG.wrapping_sub(P1_FIG_initial)`, yielding a massive delta, and thus an inflated `tokens_owed`. (This state should also be verified).

The recommended fix remains to use `saturating_sub` for the out-of-range calculations within `get_fee_growth_inside` (e.g., `O_L.saturating_sub(O_U)`). This would correctly yield 0 if an underflow would otherwise occur, reflecting that no *new* fees are generated *inside* an out-of-range position at that moment, and preventing the generation of the artifactual `W_FIG`.

I trust this detailed explanation clarifies the specific mechanism of concern. I am happy to provide further details on the conceptual POC steps if that would assist your team's testing and verification.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
