Hi [Team/Rainray],

Thank you for sharing your test results and methodology, and for the offer to review the test project. This detailed feedback is invaluable, and I believe we are very close to a common understanding of the precise conditions under discussion.

Your test execution in Phase 2 correctly highlights how `TickState::cross` updates the `fee_growth_outside_X` values (O_L and O_U) as the price sweeps across ticks. When you calculate the fee for the attacker's position (P1) after this sweep (with T_C = -150), `get_fee_growth_inside` indeed uses these *newly updated* `O_L_crossed` and `O_U_crossed` values. Since your logs show `O_L_crossed (3.99e15) > O_U_crossed (0.46e15)` at that point, the `O_L_crossed.wrapping_sub(O_U_crossed)` correctly produced a normal, non-wrapped positive value, and thus no issue was seen *in that specific final calculation for P1*.

This confirms that if the ticks defining the range are crossed (and their `fee_growth_outside_X` values are thus updated/flipped by `TickState::cross`) *before* the critical `get_fee_growth_inside` call is made for the `ProtocolPositionState` in a way that would use the *originally engineered* `O_L_initial` and `O_U_initial` values for an out-of-range calculation, the wrap might not occur with those specific updated values.

The vulnerability I'm emphasizing hinges on the `ProtocolPositionState` for the range `[T_L, T_U]` having its `fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` updated by a `get_fee_growth_inside` call that uses `O_L` and `O_U` values that *still hold an exploitable relationship (e.g., O_U_engineered > O_L_engineered)*, while `tick_current` is already out of range *relative to T_L and T_U*, and *before* those `O_L` and `O_U` values are themselves flipped by a price sweep relevant to the attacker's main claim.

The key is the state of `O_L` and `O_U` in the `TickState` accounts *at the moment `get_fee_growth_inside` is called to update the `ProtocolPositionState` for the range `[T_L, T_U]`*.

**Refined Conceptual POC Steps Focusing on `TickState::update` for Setup:**

This version focuses on how `TickState::update` (during tick initialization) can set `fee_growth_outside_X` to create the exploitable condition more directly:

1.  **Create Pool.** `PoolState.fee_growth_global_0_x64` (G) is initially 0. Let `tick_spacing = s`.
2.  **Set High `O_U` for `T_U` (e.g., tick 100):**
    a.  Perform swaps to increase global fee growth `G` to `G_high` (e.g., a substantial value like `1000 * Q64`).
    b.  Ensure `PoolState.tick_current` is `>= T_U` (e.g., by swapping price to `T_U = 100` or just above).
    c.  **Initialize `T_U`**: Call `open_position` to create a temporary position (TempPos_U) at `[T_U, T_U+s]`. According to `TickState::update` logic, since `T_U <= tick_current` at this initialization, `T_U.fee_growth_outside_0_x64` (our `O_U`) will be set to `G_high`. Close TempPos_U.
    *   *Verification:* Read `TickState` for `T_U`; confirm `O_U = G_high`.
3.  **Set `O_L` to Zero for `T_L` (e.g., tick -100):**
    a.  Perform swaps to ensure `PoolState.tick_current` is now *less than* `T_L` (e.g., `tick_current = T_L - s`). `G` may have increased further to `G_current_for_L_init`.
    b.  **Initialize `T_L`**: Call `open_position` to create a temporary position (TempPos_L) at `[T_L, T_L+s]`. According to `TickState::update`, since `T_L > tick_current` at this moment of initialization, `T_L.fee_growth_outside_0_x64` (`O_L`) will be set to `0`.
    *   *Verification:* Read `TickState` for `T_L`; confirm `O_L = 0`.
    *At this point, the `TickState` accounts persistently store `O_L = 0` and `O_U = G_high`. `tick_current` is `< T_L`.*

4.  **User Y (Victim/Normal LP) Opens Position P_Y `[T_L, T_U]` (Establishes a Normal Snapshot *before* corruption):**
    *   User Y calls `open_position`. For this step to set up a "normal" snapshot for User Y, let's assume `tick_current` is temporarily moved to be *within* `[T_L, T_U)` OR ensure the `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}` is updated with `O_L=0, O_U=G_high` but with `tick_current` in-range such that `get_fee_growth_inside` calculates a normal, small, non-wrapped value (`ProtoFIG_normal`). For instance, if `tick_current` is between `T_L` and `T_U`, and `G_current_for_Y_open` is the current global growth, `ProtoFIG_normal = G_current_for_Y_open.saturating_sub(O_L).saturating_sub(O_U)`.
    *   `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}.fee_growth_inside_0_last_x64` is `ProtoFIG_normal`.
    *   User Y's `P_Y.PersonalPositionState.fee_growth_inside_0_last_x64` (`P_Y_FIG_normal_snapshot`) is set to `ProtoFIG_normal`.

5.  **Trigger `ProtocolPositionState` Corruption (Attacker's Action or Helper):**
    *   Ensure `tick_current` is now `< T_L` (as established in step 3a, or move it there *without crossing `T_L` or `T_U` again if their FGOs were `0` and `G_high` respectively and we want to preserve those specific `O_L`/`O_U` values* - this detail is important for POC construction).
    *   An attacker or a helper LP (P_helper) makes a tiny liquidity modification to *their own separate position* P_helper, which is also in the range `[T_L, T_U]`. This calls `modify_position` for `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}`.
    *   `get_fee_growth_inside` is called. It uses the live `O_L=0` and `O_U=G_high` from the `TickState` accounts. Since `tick_current < T_L`, it calculates `FIG_calc = O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U) = 0.wrapping_sub(G_high) = W_FIG` (massive wrapped value).
    *   `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}.fee_growth_inside_0_last_x64` is now updated to `W_FIG`.
    *   ***Devnet Verification 1:*** Fetch `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}`. Confirm its `fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` is `W_FIG` (equal to `U128_MOD - G_high`).

6.  **User Y (Victim) Claims Fees:**
    *   User Y now updates their position P_Y (e.g., calls `decrease_liquidity`).
    *   `calculate_latest_token_fees` for P_Y uses:
        *   `latest_protocol_fig = ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` (which is `W_FIG`).
        *   `personal_last_fig = P_Y_FIG_normal_snapshot` (User Y's old, small, normal snapshot).
    *   The delta is `user_delta_raw = W_FIG.wrapping_sub(P_Y_FIG_normal_snapshot)`. This results in a **massive, incorrect positive delta**.
    *   This inflated delta leads to User Y (the victim in this setup, or the attacker if they were User Y) claiming excessive fees from the pool.
    *   ***Devnet Verification 2:*** Fetch User Y's `PersonalPositionState`. Confirm `tokens_owed_X` is anomalously large.

This refined POC focuses on the initialization order of `fee_growth_outside_X` for `T_L` and `T_U` to create the `O_L=0, O_U=G_high` state. Then, an update to the `ProtocolPositionState` (triggered by any liquidity event in that range) while `tick_current < T_L` will use these specific `O_L` and `O_U` values, calculate `W_FIG`, and store it. Any *existing* `PersonalPositionState` in that range that had a normal prior snapshot will then be vulnerable to calculating an inflated delta against this corrupted protocol state value.

The Uniswap v3 equivalent would have reverted when `get_fee_growth_inside` tried to compute `0 - G_high`, preventing `W_FIG` from being stored in the first place.

The fix involves two parts:
1.  `get_fee_growth_inside` must not return an artifactually massive value for out-of-range scenarios. Using `saturating_sub` for the `O_L - O_U` terms (e.g., `O_L.saturating_sub(O_U)`) would yield 0 if an underflow would otherwise occur, correctly reflecting that no *new* fees are generated *inside* an out-of-range position *at that moment*.
2.  The delta calculation in `calculate_latest_token_fees` (and `PersonalPositionState::update_rewards`), currently `latest_protocol_fig.wrapping_sub(personal_last_fig)`, must *also* use `saturating_sub` (i.e., `latest_protocol_fig.saturating_sub(personal_last_fig)`). This ensures that if `latest_protocol_fig` (now correctly 0 or small from a fixed `get_fee_growth_inside`) is less than `personal_last_fig` (e.g., 100 from past accrual), the delta becomes 0 for *newly accrued fees*, not `U128_MOD - 100`.

This combination ensures that neither the calculation of total fees for the range nor the delta calculation for the user produces these massive, artificial values from `wrapping_sub` underflows.

I hope this provides the necessary detail for your team to construct a definitive devnet POC. I'm available for further discussion or to review your test project if that's helpful.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
