Hi [Team/Rainray],

Thank you for your reply and for pushing for more clarity and concrete evidence. I understand your points and the request for detailed test steps.

Let me address your first concern regarding the use of `saturating_sub`:

> "As mentioned before, we cannot simply use `saturating_sub` to set the result to 0, otherwise, the subsequent delta calculation will be incorrect."

You've highlighted an important interaction. If `get_fee_growth_inside` were to return `0` (e.g., from `O_L.saturating_sub(O_U)` where `O_U > O_L`) when the price is out of range, and this `0` updates `ProtocolPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64`, then a user whose `PersonalPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` was, for example, `100` (from legitimate past accrual) would indeed have their next delta calculated by `calculate_latest_token_fees` as `U128::from(0.wrapping_sub(100))`. This would result in `2^128 - 100`, which is still an incorrect, massive value for *newly accrued fees* (which should be 0 if price is still out of range).

My apologies if my previous suggestion of `saturating_sub` in `get_fee_growth_inside` as a standalone fix was incomplete in addressing this downstream delta calculation's use of `wrapping_sub`.

The core issue I am focused on is the **initial generation of an artifactually massive positive number by `get_fee_growth_inside`** when the price is out of range. This happens because of `O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U)` (or vice-versa) where `O_L` and `O_U` are disparate historical snapshots. This artifactual value (let's call it `W_FIG`) is what corrupts the system from that point forward.

**The Critical Difference with Uniswap v3:**
The Uniswap v3 `Tick.sol#L60` code, in an equivalent out-of-range scenario (e.g., `tickCurrent < tickLower` and `upper.feeGrowthOutside > lower.feeGrowthOutside`), would attempt `lower.feeGrowthOutside - upper.feeGrowthOutside`. Standard Solidity checked arithmetic **would cause the transaction to REVERT due to underflow.** It does *not* produce a massive wrapped positive value for `feeGrowthInside`. This is a fundamental difference: Uniswap v3 prevents this artifactual `W_FIG` from ever being computed and stored. Your system, with `wrapping_sub` in this specific part of `get_fee_growth_inside`, allows it.

**The Exploitable "Transition Problem" in Your Current Code:**

The vulnerability arises when:
1.  `get_fee_growth_inside` (when price is out of range and, e.g., `O_U > O_L`) incorrectly calculates `FIG_calc = O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U) = W_FIG` (an artifactually massive value).
2.  This `W_FIG` updates `ProtocolPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64`.
3.  A `PersonalPositionState` has its own prior snapshot, `P_FIG_normal` (a small, non-wrapped value, e.g., 10).
4.  When this user claims, `calculate_latest_token_fees` computes the user's delta as:
    `user_delta_raw = U128::from( W_FIG (from ProtocolPositionState) .wrapping_sub( P_FIG_normal (from PersonalPositionState) ) )`
    (This is based on the line `U128::from(fee_growth_inside_latest_x64.wrapping_sub(fee_growth_inside_last_x64))` in `calculate_latest_token_fees`).
5.  This calculation (`MassiveArtifactualValue - SmallNormalValue`) yields a **huge, incorrect positive `user_delta_raw`**.
6.  This inflated delta, when scaled by liquidity via `mul_div_floor` and then subjected to `.to_underflow_u64()`, can lead to the user claiming far more fees/rewards than legitimately earned if the result fits `u64` but is still excessively large.

Your example (`last_FG = MAX-1000`, `current_FG = 500` => `delta = 1500`) describes a counter *legitimately* wrapping. The exploit describes `current_FG` becoming `W_FIG` (an artifact, not legitimate accumulation) and then being differenced against a normal `last_FG`.

**Devnet POC Steps (Conceptual Outline):**

To provide the concrete evidence you've requested, the goal is to demonstrate `ProtocolPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` being set to an artifactual `W_FIG` and then an inflated claim.

*   **Phase 1: Engineer Tick States `O_L` and `O_U`**
    1.  Create a new pool. Let `tick_spacing` be, for example, 10.
    2.  Select target ticks `T_L` (e.g., 1000) and `T_U` (e.g., 2000).
    3.  **Set Low `O_L`:**
        *   Perform minimal swaps so `PoolState.fee_growth_global_X` (G) is small (e.g., `G_low = 1000`).
        *   Ensure `T_L` is initialized. If not, open a tiny position that crosses/initializes `T_L` while `tick_current >= T_L`. Its `fee_growth_outside_X` (`O_L`) will be set to `G_low`.
        *   *Verify `O_L` from `TickState` for `T_L`.*
    4.  **Increase Global Fees:** Perform many swaps to significantly increase `PoolState.fee_growth_global_X` to `G_high` (e.g., `G_high = 1,000,000,000`).
    5.  **Set High `O_U`:**
        *   Ensure `T_U` is initialized. If not, open a tiny position that crosses/initializes `T_U` while `tick_current >= T_U`. Its `fee_growth_outside_X` (`O_U`) will be set to `G_high`.
        *   Now, `O_U` (based on `G_high`) should be much larger than `O_L` (based on `G_low`).
        *   *Verify `O_U` from `TickState` for `T_U`.*

*   **Phase 2: Exploit Demonstration**
    6.  **Attacker's Position:** Attacker calls `open_position` for a minimal liquidity position (P1) in range `[T_L, T_U]`. Record its initial `P1.PersonalPositionState.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` (as `P1_FIG_initial`). This should be a normal value based on `G_high`, `O_L`, and `O_U` when `tick_current` is within `[T_L, T_U)`.
    7.  **Move Price Out of Range:** Perform swaps to move `PoolState.tick_current` to be less than `T_L` (e.g., to tick 900).
    8.  **Trigger ProtocolPosition Update & Corruption:**
        *   Have another user (or the attacker via a separate helper position P2, also in range `[T_L, T_U]`) make a tiny liquidity modification (e.g., `increase_liquidity` with `liquidity_delta = 1`) to P2.
        *   This calls `modify_position` for `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}`.
        *   `get_fee_growth_inside` is called. Since `tick_current < T_L` and we engineered `O_U > O_L`, `fee_growth_inside_calculated = O_L.wrapping_sub(O_U)` results in `W_FIG` (a huge wrapped number).
        *   `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}.fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` is updated to `W_FIG`.
        *   ***Devnet Verification 1:*** Fetch `ProtocolPositionState_{[T_L,T_U]}`. Confirm its `fee_growth_inside_X_last_x64` is `W_FIG`.
    9.  **Attacker Claims Inflated Fees:**
        *   Attacker calls `decrease_liquidity` on their position P1.
        *   `calculate_latest_token_fees` for P1 computes `delta_for_user_raw = U128::from(W_FIG.wrapping_sub(P1_FIG_initial))`. This will be a massive positive delta.
        *   `tokens_owed_for_P1` is calculated from this.
        *   ***Devnet Verification 2:*** Fetch P1's `PersonalPositionState`. Confirm `tokens_owed_X` is anomalously large.

The fundamental fix is to prevent `get_fee_growth_inside` from returning an artifactually massive `W_FIG`. If it correctly determined that for an out-of-range position, the *current contribution to inside growth* is 0 (while past growth is handled by snapshots), the problem wouldn't arise. Using `saturating_sub` for the `O_L - O_U` terms (or vice-versa) in the out-of-range cases within `get_fee_growth_inside` is one way to achieve this specific part, ensuring it yields 0 if it would otherwise be negative and wrap. This mirrors the *outcome* of Uniswap v3's revert (no massive positive `feeGrowthInside` is generated).

If the delta calculation in `calculate_latest_token_fees` *also* needs to change from `wrapping_sub` to `saturating_sub` to handle cases where a corrected (non-W_FIG) `fee_growth_inside_latest` might be less than `fee_growth_inside_last` (e.g., if global growth could somehow reverse, though unlikely for fees), that's a separate hardening. But the primary vulnerability is the generation of `W_FIG`.

I trust this provides the detailed steps and reasoning needed.

Thank you,
